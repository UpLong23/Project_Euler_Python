## Sum square difference
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
<p align='center'>
  1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385
</p>
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
<p align='center'>
  (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025
</p>
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
<p>
  3025 - 385 = 2640
</p>
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
